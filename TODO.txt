# TODO

- simplify the data returned by the scrapers, no need for both future & past
- clean up data format, rename json to url perhaps?
- fix dark mode - note plus, arrow-left icon colors are likely to break
- add country, city specific pages, e.g. techtrib.es/fi/helsinki 
- add home page
- add tag specific pages, e.g. techtrib.es/javascript
- add sitemap
- show counters next to headings, e.g. "Upcoming events (10)"
- find a more stable solution than uncss
